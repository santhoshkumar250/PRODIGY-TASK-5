# PRODIGY-TASK-5

In this last task of packet sniffing, we have learned several key insights about network behavior and security:
  1. Traffic Analysis: We can understand the types of data flowing through a network, identifying common protocols and usage patterns.

  2. Network Performance: By monitoring packet flow, we can detect bottlenecks, latency issues, and overall network health, allowing for better optimization.

  3. Security Vulnerabilities: Packet sniffing helps identify unauthorized access attempts, data breaches, and other malicious activities, enabling proactive security measures.

  4. Protocol Understanding: It enhances our knowledge of how different protocols operate and interact, which is crucial for troubleshooting and development.

  5. Data Integrity: We can verify that data is being transmitted as intended, checking for corruption or tampering during transmission.

Overall, packet sniffing is a powerful technique for maintaining and securing network infrastructures.

A packet sniffer is a tool used to monitor and capture network traffic in real-time. In a GitHub repository, the packet sniffer task involves developing a software application that can intercept data packets traveling across a network. This can be useful for network analysis, troubleshooting, and security auditing.

The implementation typically requires using libraries that can access raw network data, such as pcap in C or Scapy in Python. The task may include filtering packets based on criteria like protocol type, source/destination IP addresses, or ports. Users can visualize the captured data in various formats to identify anomalies, monitor bandwidth usage, or detect unauthorized access.
